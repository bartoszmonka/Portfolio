## About me
I am a certified software tester with over 6 years of commercial experience in banking application testing, both on the frontend. I spent 3 years in a five-member development team on a project to settle invoices for the financial department in a bank. Furthermore, my tenure at the Viessmann Research & Development Center has significantly enriched my professional journey. Over a period of 2 years and 3 months, I worked as Software Quality Assurance Engineer, and I am automating Android functional tests. In my current capacity as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer at eSky Group, a venture I am undertaking independently, I have leveraged my expertise in manual mobile app testing for both Android and iOS platforms. My responsibilities encompass identifying, meticulously analyzing, and comprehensively documenting defects using Jira. Additionally, I have conducted backend testing to ensure the robustness and reliability of applications. This experience has solidified my skill set in maintaining the quality of applications, with a focus on mobile app testing

I'm oriented for further development as QA Engineer\Test Automation Developer (web and mobile applications).
